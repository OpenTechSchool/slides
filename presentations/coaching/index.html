        </header>
        <p>You are about to help out at an OpenTechSchool workshop as a coach. With this presentation we want to give you a quick introduction of what that means.</p>
        <p>The focus for the event is to show learners that coding and tech is nothing to be afraid of, but rather a lot of fun!</p>

          <h2>Introduction to Coaching</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This OTS coaching style has its roots in the <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/teacher_training">RailsBridge teaching style.</a> As such it is very focused on creating a friendly and open environment for learners of all sorts.</p>
        <p>Achieving this and having a pleasant learning experience is the focus of this presentation.</p>

          <h2>The Material</h2>
        </header>
        <p>We strongly believe the best way to learn to code -- or any other tech-related subject, for that matter -- is with a hands-on, experience-oriented, and pragmatic workshop that someone can work through at their own pace. Our curricula are designed for exactly that purpose.</p>
        <p>This is also reflected in the way we organise ourselves on site: there is no classroom-style setting; everyone has their own workspace instead. There is no teacher in front and no one going through the material with a presenter.</p>

          Chances are, there is a specific question when the learner asks you to help them. How do you respond?

            <li><strong>Positevly</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>"I’m glad you asked that."</li>
                <li>"What an interesting question!"</li>

              </ul>
