        </header>
        <p>You are about to help out at an OpenTechSchool workshop as a coach. With this presentation we want to give you a quick introduction of what that means.</p>
        <p>The focus for the event is to show learners that coding and tech is nothing to be afraid of but is a lot of fun.</p>

          <h2>Introduction to Coaching</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This OTS coaching style has its root in the <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/teacher_training">RailsBridge teaching style.</a> As such it is very focussed on creating a friendly and open environment for learners of all sorts.</p>
        <p>How to achieve this and have a pleasant learning experience is focus of this presentation.</p>

          <h2>The Material</h2>
        </header>
        <p>We strongly believe the best way to learn to code - or any other tech related topic for that matter - is by hands-on, experience oriented and pragmatic workshop worked through on ones own pace. Our curricula are designed for exactly that purpose.</p>
        <p>That is also reflected in the way we organise ourself on sight: there is no class-room-style setting, everyone has their own workspace instead. There is no teacher in front and there is no one going through the material with a presenter.</p>

            <li>Focus on the learners</li>
            <li>Have sympathy for their (in-)abilities</li>
            <li>Encourage to go further through motivation</li>

          Chances are, there is a certain question when the learner calls you to help them. How do you respond? 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Positevly</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>i’m glad you said that</li>
                <li>what an interesting question</li>
                <li>great question</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If in doubt: blame the material, never the learner</li>

            <li>Talk sssssslllllloooooowwwwwwllllllyyyyyyyy.</li>

        <p>It is just confusing to learners: In the tech community we are having some strong opinions and our ways to express those. But for people new to it this can quickly look like a huge fight. And we do not fight each other.
        </p>
        <p>We are here to coach you in this programming language/method/technology and that is the focus for this event.</p>
